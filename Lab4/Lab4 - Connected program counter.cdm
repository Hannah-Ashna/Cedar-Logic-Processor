# CEDAR Logic RAM memory file.
# The file format is:
# "hex_address : hex_data"
#
# For example, if the address "0" contained the decimal
# number "18", then the line for that address would be:
# "0 : 12"
#
# Note that if a memory location is not represented here,
# then it is assumed to contain the data value "0"
