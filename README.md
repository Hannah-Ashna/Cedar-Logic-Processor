# Cedar Logic - Modifying Circuits and a Processor
As part of my Computer Technology & Maths module at NTU we had to submit a portfolio in addition to a [project](https://github.com/Hannah-Ashna/68K-Assembler).
We were given different circuits, including a complete processor in Cedar Logic to modify to fit the requirements of each week's lab task.
